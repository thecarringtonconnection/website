    comment: I’ve been having sessions with Mike for over a year now. He has always given me a safe space to breathe and process my thoughts, feelings and experiences. We’ve covered a wide range of topics over the past year - everything from attachment, ocd, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, health issues and other past trauma - and he’s always listened and helped me explore and process these in sessions, whilst also providing me with processes and reading materials when requested outside of sessions. Thank you, Mike!
