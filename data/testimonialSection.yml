          *Having had several false starts with different therapists, I started seeing Mike just under a year ago and haven’t looked back. Our weekly sessions have been vital in helping me start to overcome issues with perfectionism and workplace anxiety. I have also been able to understand how these issues have been influenced by, and impacted upon, other aspects of my life.*


          *Mike has built a program that works for me as an individual. He is extremely enthusiastic, considerate and non-judgemental. We often go through different exercises, some of which I have been sceptical about at first, which have offered variety and really helped changed my perspective on things. Most importantly, he has taken the time to understand my thought process to ensure that every session builds on the last.*


          *I really couldn’t recommend Mike highly enough and have noticed real positive changes in my mental health since we started sessions!*

          *My time with Mike has been amazing. We clicked from the very first session and so I felt comfortable to go deep into some uncomfortable personal issues that I was facing both past and present. He was someone who I felt I could trust and who did his best to understand things from my perspective.*


          *Each session provided a solid mix of affirmation and encouragement, and so I left each session feeling much lighter. The cumulative effect has ended up having a really positive impact on my life - more so than I expected.*

          *I’ve been having sessions with Mike for over a year now. He has always given me a safe space to breathe and process my thoughts, feelings and experiences.*


          *We’ve covered a wide range of topics over the past year - everything from attachment, ocd, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, health issues and other past trauma - and he’s always listened and helped me explore and process these in sessions, whilst also providing me with processes and reading materials when requested for outside of sessions.*


          *Thank you, Mike!*
