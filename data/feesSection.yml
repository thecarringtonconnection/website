 #### Initial Consultation

 I also offer a free initial consultation before clients start counselling. This helps to
 identify whether counselling is right for you and gives you an opportunity to ask me any
 questions you might have about the service or the counselling process. A consultation
 lasts 20 minutes and can be carried out online or over the phone.

  ## Services & Fees

serviceInfo: >
  I offer in-person, online and telephone counselling sessions to individuals aged 18 and over.


  As a gay man and LGBTQIA+ counsellor, I understand the challenges that many LGBTQIA+ individuals face.
  You may be interested in coming for counselling to talk in confidence about issues relating to your
  sexuality or gender identity. Or you may want to explore other issues and feel more comfortable
  talking to a counsellor who identifies as LGBTQIA+.


  I provide a safe, confidential, and non-judgemental space in which you can explore
  your thoughts, feelings and concerns, helping you to understand more about yourself, your
  situation and your relationships with others.
