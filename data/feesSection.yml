  I offer counselling and psychotherapy to individuals aged 18 and over in-person, online, and via
  telephone, with the option of weekly or fortnighly sessions. I offer both short-term and long-term
  counselling and psychotherapy, and suggest that we review your progress every six weeks, to ensure that
  you are getting the most out of your sessions.


  I provide a safe, confidential, and non-judgemental space in which you can explore
  your thoughts, feelings and concerns, helping you to understand more about yourself, your
  situation and your relationships with others.
