  #### Integrative Counsellor and Psychotherapist

  As an integrative counsellor, I work with a variety of therapeutic approaches and methods, combining them to suit the needs of each individual client.


  I provide a safe, confidential, and non-judgemental space in which clients can explore their thoughts and feelings, allowing them to understand more about themselves and their relationships with others.


  Mike believes that this safe and supportive environment is fundamental for successful therapy, as it allows the client to open up and explore their concerns, and so start to facilitate therapeutic change.
