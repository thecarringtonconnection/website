  #### Integrative Counsellor and Psychotherapist

  As an integrative counsellor, I work with a variety of therapeutic approaches and methods, combining them to suit the needs of each individual client.


  I provide a safe, confidential, and non-judgemental space in which clients can explore their thoughts and feelings, allowing them to understand more about themselves and their relationships with others.


  Mike believes that this safe and supportive environment is fundamental for successful therapy, as it allows the client to open up and explore their concerns, and so start to facilitate therapeutic change.


  I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and work in accordance with their Ethical Framework. This helps to ensure safe, ethical and professional practice and to make sure that the client is constantly at the heart of my work.
