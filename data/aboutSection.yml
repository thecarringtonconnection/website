  #### Integrative Counsellor and Psychotherapist

  I am an integrative counsellor and psychotherapist, which involves working with a variety of therapeutic approaches,
  such as Person-Centred, Psychodynamic, Existential, and CBT, and combining them to suit the needs of each individual client.


  As a gay man and LGBTQIA+ counsellor, I am passionate about supporting LGBTQIA+ adults on their journal to positive mental health.


  I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and work in accordance with their
  Ethical Framework. This helps to ensure safe, ethical and professional practice and to make sure that the client is
  constantly at the heart of my work.
