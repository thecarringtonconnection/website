      ##### LGBTQIA+ Affirmative Counsellor and Psychotherapist

      A qualified, integrative therapist who combines Person-Centred, Psychodynamic, Existential, and CBT approaches to suit the needs of each individual client.


      I firmly believe that the therapeutic relationship and a safe, supportive environment are fundamental for successful therapy as they help clients to open up and explore their concerns.


      I am also a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), working in accordance with their ethical framework.
