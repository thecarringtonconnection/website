  ## Services

serviceInfo: >
  I offer counselling and psychotherapy to individuals aged 18 and over in-person, online, and via
  telephone, with the option of weekly or fortnighly sessions. I offer both short-term and long-term
  counselling and psychotherapy, and suggest that we review your progress every six weeks, to ensure that
  you are getting the most out of your sessions.


  I provide a safe, confidential, and non-judgemental space in which you can explore
  your thoughts, feelings and concerns, helping you to understand more about yourself, your
  situation and your relationships with others.


  As a gay man and LGBTQIA+ counsellor, I understand the challenges that many LGBTQIA+ individuals face.
  You may be interested in coming for counselling to talk in confidence about issues relating to your
  sexuality or gender identity. Or you may want to explore other issues and feel more comfortable
  talking to a counsellor who identifies as LGBTQIA+.


  My counselling experience includes supporting clients with the following issues:
